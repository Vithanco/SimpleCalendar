# ``SimpleCalendar``

``SimpleCalendar`` brings the use of a _simple calendar_ right into your app. There are no fancy sliders nor is its purpose to mimic Apple's Calendar app. 
As its title suggests, it is meant to be a simple calendar.

@Metadata {
    @PageImage(
        purpose: icon, 
        source: "icon", 
        alt: "Simple Calendar icon.")
    @PageColor(orange)
}

## Overview

Simple Calendar's content is based on the use of activity (``ActivityRepresentable``) and events (``EventRepresentable``), where an activity can occur multiple times with the 
use of events. An activity can have a certain type, a category if you will, which defines a name and a color for said type making the activity stand out.
